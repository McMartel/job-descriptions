Do you want to work on products that help make the world a better place?

Would you enjoy working with a diverse, talented, and passionate team to make sure that researchers and policy makers around the world have the best data and insights for their communities to be successful?

Do you love working with the latest technology and tools?

If so, this is your opportunity to work on applications used around the world, in a position where your work can make a difference in millions of lives.


## What we do

We take real world government data and research, and turn them into interactive data tools affecting policy at the highest levels. The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets users interactively visualize a country’s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. 

We're now working with individual countries to take their biggest civic datasets and direct regional development using network analysis and visualization. 


### Our stack

We use python, django, postgres, elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. 
For the frontend, it's ember and d3 on projects in Mexico in Colombia, jquery and d3 on atlas.cid.harvard.edu, and WebGL with Three.js on some 3d projects that we’ve launched such as globe.cid.harvard.edu/

Everything we do is open source: https://github.com/cid-harvard
