About Us
========

The Growth Lab engineering and visualization team, part of the Center for International Development at Harvard.

#### Who we are:
We're a small engineering team inside the Harvard Growth Lab, working with a large group of brilliant researchers who tackle the problem of inclusive economic growth from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, and international development. 

As engineers our past work ranges from software startups, to electoral campaign data teams, to PHDs in computer science.

#### What we do:

We explore real world government data and ongoing research, and use these to create interactive data viz tools. The [Atlas of Economic Complexity] (http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu) is an online tool that lets you interactively visualize a nationâ€™s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. Some of our biggest projects involve expanding this to allow researchers, policy makers, and local leaders to do similar analysis on individual cities and regions within a country. Our first 'local' atlas is the [Mexican Atlas of Economic Complexity] (http://complejidad.datos.gob.mx), with tools launching soon in Colombia and Peru. The local atlases are a big deal because with huge gaps in development and job opportunities between regions in those countries, policy makers and local leaders need to think differently about the places that are still catching up.

In 2015 we also launched [The Globe] (http://globe.cid.harvard.edu), an experimental take on the same concepts using WebGL to drive a 3D experience with world trade data.
