About Us
========

The Growth Lab engineering and visualization team, part of the Center for International Development at Harvard.

#### Who we are:
We're a small engineering team inside the Harvard Growth Lab, working with a large group of brilliant researchers who tackle the problem of inclusive economic growth from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, and international development. 

As engineers our past work ranges from software startups, to electoral campaign data teams, to PHDs in computer science.

#### What we do:
We take real world government data and research, and turn those into interactive data viz tools. The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a countryâ€™s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. We also launched The Globe of Economic Complexity, an experimental take on the same concepts using WebGL to drive a 3D experience with world trade data. There are also other National Atlas projects going live in 2015, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.

The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice based on our economic theories, and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level.
