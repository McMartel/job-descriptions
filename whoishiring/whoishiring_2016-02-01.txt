What we do:
We take real world government data and research, and turn them into interactive data viz tools. The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country’s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. Last year we launched a Mexican Atlas http://complejidad.datos.gob.mx/ which allows users to explore data and understand policy effects at regional and local levels. This year we are launching similar tools in Colombia and Peru.

Our stack:
We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it's ember / d3 on the country projects, jquery/d3 on atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ and WebGL with Three.js on some 3d projects that we’ve launched such as globe.cid.harvard.edu/ Everything we do is open source: https://github.com/cid-harvard

Demo of the current atlas:
An example of how the atlas is useful take this story here: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/how-much-europe-depends-on-russian-energy.html

Recently the EU placed sanctions on sales of oil equipment, but not on oil imports. Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia's exports are petrol products: http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2014/

And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:
http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2709/2014/

The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim: http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/show/all/2709/2014/

There’s practically no one who’s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It’s interesting how it’s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that’s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front.
It’s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:
http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all/2709/2014/

Which probably explains why EU hasn't placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.

Think you could design/build/use this better? We think you can too!
